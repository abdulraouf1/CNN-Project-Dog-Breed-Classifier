# CNN-Project-Dog-Breed-Classifier

Second project of Udacity deep learning nanodegree.

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, I will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I will make important design decisions about the user experience for my app.
